# MODULE: outputs/SVG
### AUTHOR: Mantacid
This module allows you to change the style section of an SVG file to use new colors.
GTK-Tint automates this by first initializing the specified SVG, adding a new class, (By default it is named `GTKt-main`), to which colors get applied. 

Right now, it's best used for monochromatic icons like those in a system tray, as advanced functionality like that of other output modules has not yet been figured out.
